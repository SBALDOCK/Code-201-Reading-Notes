### What Google Learned About Teams

#### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

##### Traditionally, it was thought that successful groups were comprise specifically of successful, or exceptional individuals. It was assumed that each individual's best qualities, when put in combination with other's best qualities, would create a superior collaborate environment for maximum productivity. Google's Project Aristotle survey nearly 180 work groups within Google and found some results that turned this assumption on its head. 

###### Instead, researchers found that a groups success had much more to do with the relationships of those within the group than with the individuals who comprised the group. They found some qualities that most or all "successful" groups possessed that differentiated them from other groups.

* Members speak in roughly the same proportion
  * "Equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking"
  * This doesn't have to be spread evenly on a single idea, but in general all members participate the sam amount

* Good teams have high "average social sensitivity"
  * Members are good at being sensitive to others, being mindful of their expressions and other cues
  * A key indicator are the eyes - "Reading the mind in the eyes test"

* These two traits are known in the world of psychology as "psychological safety...a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking"
  * Interpersonal trust and mutual respect are the foundations

* Google concluded that psychological safety is the most important factor that leads to the success of a group of collaborators
  * The challenge is implementing this culture with people who might tend to work individually as developers and don't necessarily want to participate in collaborative work
  * Emotional vulnerability amongst team members can bring people closer together and realize that they have more in common than they would have thought 
  * When you can build empathy with others, a trusting connection can lead to a healthier work dynamic

* The conclusion is that there is a link between psychological safety and emotional vulnerability
  * These same two core aspects are important qualities in relationships
  * Human bonds can mean more than the work itself
  * To be safe means being able to bring some of your personal life to work and know that you won't be judged for it...to be able to express fears or a lack of understanding in a safe environment

* Collecting data on psychological safety makes the execution of it easier for those in the tech world, which is traditionally a career type that does encourage the expression of feelings or opinions
